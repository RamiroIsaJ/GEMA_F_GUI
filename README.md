# GEMA_F_GUI
GEMA_F by **GEMA for Segmentation in brigth and fluorescence fields** is a GUI Interface programmed in *PYTHON* using PySimpleGUI for segmentation and computing the area of cells automatically in image datasets.
The GUI is a test version 1.2.1 and the GEMA algorithms is an improve for previous version presented in https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/8/10/281. The current version is the 3.6.8.

In the directory */src*, you will find an user guide document.

## Run of GEMA_F_GUI
This program can be used for cell regions using the Gabor Filter and morphological operations to improve the automatic detection in images. The GEMA algorithm run in two fields: brigth and flourescence.

## Results of GEMA_F_GUI
Results are presented in csv files with values of detected area in pixels and micrometers. The accuracy of algorith has been computed using the gold standard segmentation.

GEMA_F_GUI Interface will be presented in a **scientific paper**.
